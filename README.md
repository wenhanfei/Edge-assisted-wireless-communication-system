# Edge-assisted-wireless-communication-system

## Introduction

*H. Wen, J. Yu, G. Pan, X. Chen, S. Zhang and S. Xu. A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Architecture for High Accurate Edge-Assisted Bandwidth Prediction.*  

  This is the Github repository for the detailed introduction of the experimental environment and data acquisition process of this letter. The main purpose of the repository is to demonstrate the built edge-assisted wireless communication system, discuss and report issues. This demo shows the architecture of the system and the process of acquiring data. All data in this letter are collected by ourselves through this system.
